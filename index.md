3rd year Engineering Science (Machine Intelligence) student passionate about ML theory, computer vision, and reinforcement learning.

## Research Experience
### Dynamic Graphics Project (DGP) Lab
- *Supervisor: Eitan Grinspun*
- Improving the reading experience of graphic novels on ebooks using computer vision and NLP.

### Vector Institute, University Health Network (DATA Team), & SickKids Hospital
- *Supervisor: Michael Brudno*
- Developed a **semi-supervised method** for neonatal brain MRI segmentation that leveraged partially annotated datasets. Addressed label scarcity in medical image segmentation and optimized clinical workflow by reducing reliance on manual annotations.

### National University of Singapore
- *Supervisor: Erik Birgersson*
- Predicted and analyzed opto-electronic properties of perovskite solar cells (PSCs) using machine learning. Demonstrated the computational efficiency of deep learning methods compared to compared to density function theory (DFT). Provided valuable insights for PSC design and manufacturing.
