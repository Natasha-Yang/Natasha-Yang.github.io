### FireNet - Next Day Wildfire Spread Prediction
- Trained a **temporal vision transformer** (Prithvi 100M) and a **(2+1)D CNN-ASPP** for spatiotemporal next-day wildfire spread prediction. Applied **GradCAM** to interpret model predictions and demonstrate alignment with physical wildfire dynamics. Achieved **state-of-the-art F1 and recall** on the WildfireSpreadTS dataset, showcasing the potential of deep learning video prediction architectures for wildfire management.

- **Code:** [FireNet](https://github.com/Natasha-Yang/FireNet)
  
### Signal Processing in Magnetic Resonance Imaging
- Provided a comprehensive overview of MRI signal processing techniques (including **phase-sensitive detection**, **Inverse Fast Fourier Transform (IFFT)**, and **compressed sensing**) with detailed derivations, serving as a valuable resource for future researchers and students.
